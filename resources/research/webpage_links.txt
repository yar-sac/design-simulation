Thread specifically discussing the downsides of using an active aerobraking system, the unavoidable inaccuracy of any simulation, the impossibility of aerodynamic modelling of a tumbling rocket. This thread points quite strongly towards going with the most simple design possible (see last comment).

Design considerations on how to win highest-altitude competitions. We would want to inherit all drag-minimising, stability-increasing techniques, but add a specific amount of weight for a target-apogee competition.

Adding drag to a model rocket. This source advises against adding weight for safety reasons, but promotes increasing aerodynamic drag.

Minimum takeoff velocity and risks associated with too-slow takeoff (too slow, and rocket is unstable as lift force is low).
